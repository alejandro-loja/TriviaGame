## Nintendo Trivia Game
This trivia game uses jQuery to make a quiz based on Nintendo History.
The rules are simple: 
Click on the Start Button to get started.
From there, you have two minutes to answer 10 questions. The game end after two minutes or if you finished answering all the questions.
At the end you will get tally of all the correct and incorrect and unanswered questions. You can click the restart button to start again.

This is how I create my project: 
- I used objects to hold each question, including the answer to each question.
- I used setTimeOut and clearInterval functions to help me with this game. 
- I also used a lot of jQuery to manipulate the DOM.
