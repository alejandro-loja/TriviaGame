##Nintendo Trivia Game
This project required the use of JavaScript and jQuery to make a quiz based on a topic.
I am employing certain features that I learned that week. 
I used objects to hold each question, including the answer to each question.
I used setTimeOut and clearInterval functions to help me with this game. 
I also used a lot of jQuery to manipulate the DOM.
